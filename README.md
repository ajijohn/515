## Objective

We are interested in changes in plasma lipid biomarkers for coronary heart disease (CHD) after hormone replacementtherapy in a sample of 2,763 womenfrom the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS). HERS wasa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to test the efficacy and safety of estrogen plus progestin therapy for prevention of recurrent coronary heart disease (CHD) events in women. 

### 1.
What associations exist between the plasma lipid biomarkers for CHD at baseline (i.e., prior to randomized treatment assignment) and the available data on participant demographics (age, race, BMI), behavior (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity), and available clinical and laboratory measures of organ system functioning (e.g, glucose, blood pressure)? 

### 2.
Is there any evidence of hormone therapy treatment effects on the plasma lipid biomarkers after one year of treatment?  

### 3.
Is there any attenuation ofthe hormone therapy treatment effects after adjustment for known risk factors for CHD? 
### 4.
Do any of thehormone therapy treatment effects identified above for the plasma lipid biomarkers differ according to race/ethnicity, statin medication use,smoking behavior, or alcohol consumption.
